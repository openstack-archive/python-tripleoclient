deprecations:
  - Ephemeral heat is now used as default for overcloud deployment
    and assumes the nodes are pre-provisioned using metalsmith. Deprecates
    existing ``--deployed-server`` option and adds an additional option
    ``--provision-nodes`` for using installed heat and provisioning
    nodes with heat.
