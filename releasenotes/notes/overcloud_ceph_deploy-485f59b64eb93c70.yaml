    A new command "openstack overcloud ceph deploy" is added. The command is
    used to deploy Ceph after the hardware has been provisioned with networking
    and before the overcloud is deployed. The command takes the output of
    "openstack overcloud node provision" as input and returns a Heat enviornment
    file, e.g. deployed_ceph.yaml, as output. The deployed_ceph.yaml file may then
    be passed to the "openstack overcloud deploy" command as input. During overcloud
    deployment the Ceph cluster is then configured to host OpenStack. E.g. cephx keys
    and pools are still created on the Ceph cluster by "openstack overcloud deploy".
