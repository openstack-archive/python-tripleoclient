    Neutron resources for overcloud deployments on the undercloud is now
    managed with tooling external to the Heat stack.

    Networks and subnet resources as well as Virtual IPs for an overcloud
    can either be manged using separate commands or the all-in-one
    ``overcloud deploy`` by using the new network data YAML definition as
    ``--networks-file`` and the ``--vip-file`` arguments with this command.

    Overcloud node network ports are now managed by the baremetal node
    provisioning workflow. Baremeteal nodes, and the network resources, can
    be provisioned using the separate ``overcloud node provision`` command.
    Alternatively the all-in-one ``overcloud deploy`` command will run the
    baremetal node provisioning steps if the ``--baremetal-deployment``
    argument is used.

    Please refer to the `Networking Version 2 (Two)
    <https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/tripleo-docs/latest/deployment/network_v2.html>`_.
    documentation page for more details.
upgrade:
  - |
    The network data defintion used with the overcloud deployement must be
    updated to version 2. The undercloud upgrade will execute the command
    (``openstack overcloud network extract``) to generate the network data
    definition for each deployed overcloud. The undercloud upgrade will save
    the new file in the working directory for each stack, defaults to
    ``overcloud-deploy/<STACK_NAME>/tripleo-<STACK_NAME>-network-data.yaml``.
  - |
    A new YAML definition file for overcloud stack virtual IPs must be used.
    The undercloud upgrade will execute the command (``overcloud network vip
    extract``) to generate this file for each deployed overcloud. The
    undercloud upgrade will save the new file in the working directory for
    each stack, defaults to
    ``overcloud-deploy/< STACK_NAME>/tripleo-<STACK_NAME>-virtual-ips.yaml``.
  - The baremetal node defintion has been extended to support neutron port
    resource managment, this requires additional input in the YAML definition
    used for baremetal node provisioning. The undercloud upgrade will execute
    the command (``overcloud node extract provisioned``) to generate this file
    for each deployed overcloud. The undercloud upgrade will save the new file
    in the working directory for each stack, defaults to
    ``overcloud-deploy/<STACK_NAME>/tripleo-<STACK_NAME>-baremetal-deployment.yaml.yaml``.
deprecations:
  - |
    To enable management of neutron resources external to Heat the network data
    YAML definition schema has been updated. The previous schema version has been
    deprecated, using the deprecated v1 schema is only possible when the deprecated
    non-ephemeral Heat on the Undercloud.
  - |
    Managing netron resources for composable networks is now enabled by default when
    provisioning baremetal nodes. The option ``--network-ports`` has been deprecated,
    and is a NOOP until it is fully removed.
