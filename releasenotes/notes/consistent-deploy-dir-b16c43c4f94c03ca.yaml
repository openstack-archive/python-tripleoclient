features:
  - A consistent working directory is now used by the openstack overcloud
    deploy command. The directory contains input files, generated files, and
    log files, among others. The directory defaults to
    ~/overcloud-deploy/<stack>. The old default config-download directory
    at ~/config-download/<stack> is now a symlink to the new location at
    ~/overcloud-deploy/<stack>/config-download/<stack> for backwards
    compatibility.
