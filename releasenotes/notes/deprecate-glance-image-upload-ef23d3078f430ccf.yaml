deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--local`` argument to the ``openstack overcloud image upload``
    command has been deprecated and a ``--no-local`` argument has been
    added. Earlier we used to fallback to upload locally when glance
    was not available. As glance is not installed in the undercloud by
    default, we would upload images locally unless ``--no-local`` is
    used.
