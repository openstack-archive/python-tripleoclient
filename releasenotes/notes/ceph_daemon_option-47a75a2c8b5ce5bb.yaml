    A new option --daemons for the "openstack overcloud ceph deploy" command
    has been added. This option may be used to define additional Ceph daemons
    that should be deployed at this stage.
    For instance, a generic Ceph daemons definition can be something like the
    following::

      ---
      ceph_nfs:
        cephfs_data: 'manila_data'
        cephfs_metadata: 'manila_metadata'
      ceph_rgw: {}
      ceph_ingress:
        tripleo_cephadm_haproxy_container_image: undercloud.ctlplane.mydomain.tld:8787/ceph/haproxy:2.3
        tripleo_cephadm_keepalived_container_image: undercloud.ctlplane.mydomain.tld:8787/ceph/keepalived:2.5.1

    For each service added to the data structure above, additional options can
    be defined and passed as extra_vars to the tripleo-ansible flow.
    If no option is specified, the default values provided by the cephadm
    tripleo-ansible role will be used.
