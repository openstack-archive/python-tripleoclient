features:
  - The "openstack tripleo deploy" and "openstack undercloud install" commands
    now save their generated artifacts from the deployment under a single
    consistent directory, which by default is located at
    ~/tripleo-deploy/<stack>. For the undercloud, this location is
    ~/tripleo-deploy/undercloud. The directory can be overridden with the
    --output-dir option.
