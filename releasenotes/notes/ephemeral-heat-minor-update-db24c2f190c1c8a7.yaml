    During a minor update of the overcloud. It was previously necessary to
    execute 3 steps.
    - Update Prepare
    - Update Run
    - Update Converge
    Starting in W, it is no longer necessary to perform a Stack update
    during the converge. This change removes the stack update from the
    converge step. Now, we will just run the deploy_steps_playbook instead.
