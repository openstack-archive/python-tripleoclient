    Expose the existing --reproduce-command from `openstack tripleo deploy`
    CLI in the Undercloud CLI commnads.
    A new CLI option --reproduce-command is available for the `openstack
    undercloud install` and `openstack undercloud upgrade` commands, which
    creates an script, named ansible-playbook-command.sh, in the Undercloud's
    deployment artifacts directory. This script allows running the Ansible
    playbooks for deployment or upgrade in the same way the CLI command does.
