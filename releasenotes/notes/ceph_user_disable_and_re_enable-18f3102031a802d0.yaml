    Two new commands, "openstack overcloud ceph user enable" and
    "openstack overcloud ceph user disable" are added. The "enable"
    option will create the cephadm SSH user and distribute their
    SSH keys to Ceph nodes in the overcloud. The "disable" option
    may be run after "openstack overcloud ceph deploy" has been run
    to disable cephadm so that it may not be used to administer the
    Ceph cluster and no "ceph orch ..." CLI commands will function.
    This will also prevent Ceph node overcloud scale operations though
    the Ceph cluster will still be able to read/write data. The "ceph
    user disable" option will also remove the public and private SSH
    keys of the cephadm SSH user on overclouds which host Ceph. The
    "ceph user enable" option may also be used to re-distribute the
    public and private SSH keys of the cephadm SSH user and re-enable
    the cephadm mgr module.
