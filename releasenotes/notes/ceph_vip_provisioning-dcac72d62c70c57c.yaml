    A new option --ceph-vip for the "openstack overcloud ceph deploy" command
    has been added. This option may be used to reserve VIP(s) for each Ceph
    service specified by the 'service/network' mapping defined as input.
    For instance, a generic ceph service mapping can be something like the
    following::

      ---
      ceph_services:
        - service: ceph_nfs
          network: storage_cloud_0
        - service: ceph_rgw
          network: storage_cloud_0

    For each service added to the list above, a virtual IP on the specified
    network is created to be used as frontend_vip of the ingress daemon. When
    no subnet is specified, a default `<network>_subnet` pattern is used. If
    the subnet does not follow the `<network>_subnet` pattern, a subnet for
    the VIP may be specified per service::

      ---
      ceph_services:
        - service: ceph_nfs
          network: storage_cloud_0
        - service: ceph_rgw
          network: storage_cloud_0
          subnet: storage_leafX

    When the `subnet` parameter is provided, it will be used by the ansible
    module, otherwise the default pattern is followed. This feature also
    supports the fixed_ips mode. When fixed_ip(s) are defined, the module is
    able to use that input to reserve the VIP on that network. A valid input
    can be something like the following::

      ---
      fixed: true
      ceph_services:
        - service: ceph_nfs
          network: storage_cloud_0
          ip_address: 172.16.11.159
        - service: ceph_rgw
          network: storage_cloud_0
          ip_address: 172.16.11.160

    When the boolean fixed is set to True, the subnet pattern is ignored, and
    a sanity check on the user input is performed, looking for the ip_address
    keys associated to the specified services.
    If the `fixed` keyword is missing, the subnet pattern is followed.
