    New command "openstack overcloud ceph spec" has been added. This command
    may be used to create a cephadm spec file as a function of the output of
    metalsmith and a TripleO roles file. For example, if metalsmith output a
    file with multiple hosts of differing roles and each role contained various
    Ceph services, then a cephadm spec file could parse these files and return
    input compatible with cephadm. The ceph spec file may be then be passed to
    "openstack overcloud ceph deploy" so that cephadm deploys only those Ceph
    services on those hosts. This feature should save users from the need to
    create two different files containing much of the same data and make it
    easier and less error prone to include Ceph in a deployment without the
    need to manually create the Ceph spec file.
