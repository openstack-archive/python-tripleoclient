    Fixes incorrect handling of root device hints when Software RAID is in
    use with Ironic. Users may re-introspect and an automatic root device hint
    would be added, which is incorrect and can lead to a failed deployment
    due to Software RAID (MD) device names being inconsistent across reboot
    from being configured to utilized. Ironic ultimately understands these
    devices and should choose the correct device by default if present.
    We now log an Warning and do not insert a potentially incorrect root
    device hint. Operators using a complex set of disks may still need to
    explicitly set a root device hint should their operational state require
    it.
